# Basic widgets

Flutter comes with a suite of powerful basic widgets, of which the following are commonly used:

## `Text`

The `Text` widget lets you create a run of styled text within your application.

## `Row`, `Column`

These flex widgets let you create flexible layouts in both the horizontal (`Row`) and vertical (`Column`) directions. The design of these objects is based on the web’s flexbox layout model.

## `Stack`

Instead of being linearly oriented (either horizontally or vertically), a `Stack` widget lets you place widgets on top of each other in paint order. You can then use the Positioned widget on children of a `Stack` to position them relative to the top, right, bottom, or left edge of the stack. Stacks are based on the web’s absolute positioning layout model.

## `Container`

The `Container` widget lets you create a rectangular visual element. A container can be decorated with a `BoxDecoration`, such as a background, a border, or a shadow. A Container can also have margins, padding, and constraints applied to its size. In addition, a `Container` can be transformed in three dimensional space using a matrix.
